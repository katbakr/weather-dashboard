# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application was made to make it easier for a user to quickly recieve information about current weather and a five day forecast for a city of their choice. The user enters the city name into the search bar and presses the search button to prompt an api call to our weather API. This will return current weather conditions: tempurature, humidity, and wind speed. The same information will be provided for the next five day forecast. In order to create ease of use for the user, this application utilizies local storage to store previous searches to make quick searches much easier.

## Usage

Using this application is very easy. Simply type in a city of your choice into the search bar and wait for the page to display current and forecasted weather for that city!
